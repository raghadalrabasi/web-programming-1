    <h2>My Hoppy</h2>
    <p>First and foremost Hi! My name is Raghad. I am currently living in the south Korea.<br>
        As you have seen in the title my hobby is &lt;photo editing &gt;. 
        Yes! I love <em>photo editing</em> so much that everyday I have new photos posted privately on my sns, 
        privately because I'm shy to show off my works to other people since I'm not that great at photo editing.
         <strong>Im also into <mark>photography</mark>,</strong> love taking random pictures in different places.<br>
        That's a sml introduction of mine. God bless us always </p>
